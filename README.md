### Welcome,

## This is where I explore making static and animated visuals using JavaScript. 

It is inspired by a course on Domestika that I completed ' Creative Coding: Making Visuals with JavaScript.
A course by Bruno Imbrizi'. 

It uses the canvas-sketch framework developed by Matt DesLauriers (https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch)
